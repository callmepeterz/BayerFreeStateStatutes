**Amendment the Third**

Within one week of an Act passed by Congress being published, a citizen may start a public proposal for a referendum in order to repeal any parts, or sections of, or all of the Act. If the number of approvals from citizens is equal to or above the total number of citizens raised to the power of zero point six five within one week of the proposal being published, a fair and secret referendum shall be held by the Government within two weeks of the referendum being approved. The aforementioned Act or parts or sections of the Act shall be repealed if the referendum achieves a three-fourths majority of the votes.
